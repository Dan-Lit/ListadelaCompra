# Shopping List App

This app was created for a friend who needed to save money by knowing exactly what to buy prior to going to the store. Because she makes weekly meal preps, this was an easy task: with this app she's now able to store all of his recipes, and when she needs it she can tell the app to generate her shopping list based on the chosen meals for that week.

The app has a simple design and a limited funcionality, but it serves its purpose. Nevertheless, I keep on listening to her suggestions and upgrading the project. Feel free to colaborate.
